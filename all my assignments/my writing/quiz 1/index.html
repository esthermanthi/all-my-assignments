<h2>THE WAY OF LIFE IN SOWETO</h2>

<p>Trevor talks about himself staying in a community that was ruled by women. He used to stay with his mother, his grandmother, great grandmother and his some of the aunties. The fathers of the kids around Soweto had been taken away by apartheid. Most of the women replaced them with religion. For instance, Trevor’s mother says that God is her husband. The women and children formed prayer meetings where they could meet in different households to pray and sing. On Tuesday nights is when  the prayer meeting would be held in Trevors’ grandmothers house and this would make Trevor happy in that he could be able to pray because he loved praying and he could clap along.</p>

<p>their toilet was shared among adjoining houses and in its inside it had a concrete with a slab hole in it and a plastic seat on top. What Trevor hated about it is that it had so many flies. Whenever there was a long drop at the bottom the flies would fly up.so one day when Trevor is left at home with Koko, he feels the urge to go for a long call but unfortunately it starts to rain which makes him think of using a newspaper  to  finish his puppy like business in their kitchen. Trevor goes to the kitchen ,takes a newspaper ,spreads it on the ground floor, finishes his puppy business and this makes him feel good because of the absence of flies. Thinking that he will do this and still get unnoticed, he turns around and sees Koko, relaxing just a few feet away from where he is doing his business. Koko can’t see him but her nose starts smelling something unusual around and this makes her call out to ask whoever is there which makes Trevor  panick  a bit though he is sure that Koko can’t see him.at long last, Trevor manages to fold the newspaper and puts it in a rubbish bin</p>

<h4>TREVOR AND PRAYING</h4>

<p>When later Trevors  grandmother comes home, Koko tells about the unusual movement she could fee in the kitchen hours back. She tells Trevor’s grandmother about it and they can both feel the unusual and strange smell in the kitchen. When Trevor’s mother comes home from work later, they also tell her about it and she spots the shit in the newspaper because of her strong sense of smell. When they know that no one had visited the room earlier, they associate this to   be a demon related thing and they call out their neighbors to come and pray for the demon.in their process of doing the prayers Trevor keeps quiet knowing in his heart and mind that these people were praying for nothing but just shit from him. He is also involved in the prayers and that night he feels guilty about it and  prays to God to forgive him.</p>
